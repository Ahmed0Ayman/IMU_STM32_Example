# IMU_STM32_Example

in this video I'm trying to fucose on a IMU concept IMU stand for irrational measurement sensor
so first where we can find this sensor we can found it in mobile phones and automotive and in navigations and so on .
there is many and many methods that used to obtain the axis of the object but here I use the simplest one so 
this sensor measure the acceleration and orientation around the axis but the each one of them has its Owen problem accel give use a good measurements
but not stable and gyro give stable measurements but with accumulation constant with the time so we need to use some how method that enable us 
to get good measure that we can count on it in our application there is to filters used to solve this problem and I used the simplest one of them Complementary Filter
there is another method called Kalman filter but it has a lot of calculations but give us very high measurements I hope this brief introduction help you 
to understand what's is going on in this project
